# PhD_thesis_supplementary_materials

This repository contains supplementary material files for my PhD thesis entitled 
"Disentangling the network: mathematical modelling of angiogenesis as a coordinated multicellular process"
which I defended in March, 2022 at the Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona. 

The numbering corresponds to the one used within the thesis. 

Some of the simulation videos uploaded here are part of supplementary materials of our publications:
